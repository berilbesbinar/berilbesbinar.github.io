I'm a researcher with 10 years of hands-on experience in computer vision and pattern recognition. I received my Bachelor's and Master's degrees from the Department of [Electrical and Electronics Engineering](https://eee.metu.edu.tr/) at [METU, Ankara](https://www.metu.edu.tr/), and my Ph.D. degree from [Computer and Communication Sciences](https://www.epfl.ch/education/phd/edic-computer-and-communication-sciences/) at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/). During my years as a graduate student at METU, I was supervised by [Prof. A. Aydin Alatan](https://eee.metu.edu.tr/personel/aydin-alatan). While my master thesis is on visual object tracking with learned representations, I also had a chance to work on object detection and segmentation in satellite images. At EPFL, I was supervised by [Prof. Pascal Frossard](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lts4/people/people-current/frossard/) for my doctoral studies. My Ph.D. thesis is on unsupervised object-centric representations for videos and multi-view images. During my time at [LTS4](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lts4/), I also worked as a doctoral researcher for the [iLearn project](https://datascience.ch/project/interpretable-learning-methods-for-immunotherapy-ilearn/), which tackled the prediction of immunotherapy response for melanoma patients based on mIF technology. In summer 2021, I did a research engineer internship at [Facebook Reality Labs](https://tech.fb.com/ar-vr/).

As a result of such a diverse portfolio, I have experience with both "old-school" methods and modern deep learning architectures. In particular, I worked with recurrent neural networks, generative models such as VAEs and WGANs, and graph neural networks. My current research interests involve learning representations of visual data in the absence of manual annotations by imposing task or data-specific inductive bias.
